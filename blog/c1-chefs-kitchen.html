          I heard of EDA through a friend, who referred me on to a couple of previous graduates. I contacted them to discuss the course and how they found it. Most my initial impressions beyond preliminary investigation of the website came from them. It really appealed as I have, briefly, been in a smaller peer-based learning environment and found that it benefited my learning style in way that lectures at University didn’t.

          I don’t think anything so far has come as much of an unexpecte surprise, but what will be a new experience for me is the emphasis on soft skills and EQ. While I had had a brief overview from those I talked to, I know more now after reading the preliminary materials and Shereef’s Fireside Chat about the best mindset and attitude to bring to EDA. I’m keen to be involved and what to get the most I can from the experience, though I should definitely fess up now to being firmly in the first of Shereef’s two fear categories: imposter syndrome. This definitely makes me nervous! It was very helpful to hear what Shereef had to say about the difference between students skills in the big scheme of things being not such a very great different after all.
